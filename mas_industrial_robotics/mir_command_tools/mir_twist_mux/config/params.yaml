# Input topics handled/muxed.
# For each topic:
# - name    : name identifier to select the topic
#   - topic   : input topic of geometry_msgs::Twist type
#   - timeout : timeout in seconds to start discarding old messages, and use 0.0 speed instead
#   - priority: priority in the range [0, 255]; the higher the more priority over other topics

# Locks to stop the twist inputs.
# For each lock:
# - topic   : input topic that provides the lock; it must be of type std_msgs::Bool?!!!
# - timeout : == 0.0 -> not used
#              > 0.0 -> the lock is supposed to published at a certain frequency in order
#                       to detect that the publisher is alive; the timeout in seconds allows
#                       to detect that, and if the publisher dies we will enable the lock
# - priority: priority in the range [0, 255], so all the topics with priority lower than it
#             will be stopped/disabled`
